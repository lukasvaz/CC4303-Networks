In June Diane visited her friends who live in San Francisco California. This was Dianeâ€™s 
first time in the city and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk around and explore.
On the first day of her trip Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension 
bridge measures 1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends did not walk across the bridge.
However they viewed it from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area which offers hiking 
trails picnicking areas and presents spectacular views of the bridge and city. Diane and
her friends made sure to take a group photograph here featuring the bridge in the background.
The next day Diane and her friends visited Alcatraz Island. This island is located 1.25
miles offshore in the San Francisco Bay. It used to serve as a lighthouse military fort
and prison. Diane and her friends took a small tour boat across bay to reach the island.
